        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Very few people exist who go about transforming a hobby they are passionate about into a flourishing business venture. Emirati Abdul Jalil Al Bulooki is one such an individual. Little did Al Bulooki expect that his hobby and a keen interest in poultry, which was nurtured from a young age, would one day become a successful commercial venture whose products will reach all corners of the UAE market.
        </p>
        <p>Once Al Bulooki determined that serving safe and healthy food products is a worthwhile mission, he went about establishing Al Bustan Farms in 1996 which is today one of the largest quail production farms in the UAE. He followed this up by setting up Al Bustan Poultry Farms LLC in 2012 to produce fresh table eggs under the brand name of Ova Plus is a state-of-the-art facility located at Sweihan, Al Ain. The company has one operational segment which includes production, grading, marketing and distribution of fresh eggs. We also offer specialty eggs from birds that are fed on diets designed to increase the nutritional content of the eggs. Our in-house veterinarians monitor our flocks at each stage of production, always looking for ways to enhance the health and well-being of the birds. Our flocks, eggs, and production facilities are subject to both internal and external audits and controls so that we can guarantee that our standards meet or exceed all industry expectations.
